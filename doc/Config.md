# Config

Database connection details are stored in the core's config and is generated by running `smol make config <coreName>`.

If the database is marked as "protected", migrations will not occur against the database and database seeds can not be performed on it. This is useful when pointing the local project at a remote database. Note that databases not on localhost are also automatically excluded from being able to be migrated or seeded.

The `outputQueries` key can be set to true to log all queries to the console. This is useful for development to see exactly what queries are being run as they're run to find performance bottlenecks or bugs.
